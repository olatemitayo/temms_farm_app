## About

### Problem statement
1. Farmers couldn't sell their crops for their original price because of the middlemen.
2. Farmers lack of knowledge about diseases affecting their crops, leading to ineffective disease management practices.
3. Farmers lack access to up-to-date weather information, which affects their decision-making in crop management.
4. Farmers lack of information on the land availability in other districts and states of the country.
5. Farmers often have questions and need assistance in various agricultural aspects but lack reliable sources for guidance.
### Solution

1. Developed an e-commerce web application where a farmer can sell his product and customers can buy the product for a minimum price. 
2. Utilized a plant-id API for accurate and timely detection of plant diseases, helping farmers identify diseases early and take appropriate measures.
3. Utilized a weather API to provide real-time weather information to farmers, enabling them to make informed decisions in crop management.
4. Utilized a map API to provide real-time availability of the farmlands which are left with rich fertility.
5. Implemented an in-built agrichat bot powered by Google Dialogflow, providing farmers with interactive assistance and answering their questions in real time.
